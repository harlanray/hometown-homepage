This is a project to help learn html & css fundamentals. It was a final solo project offered by Scrimba at the end of their "Learn HTML and CSS" course. You are required to implement the material learned throughout the course along with bonus skills that where sprinkled throughout the course and/or that you may have aquired elsewhere.

Initially appeared on [GitHub (repo)]().
